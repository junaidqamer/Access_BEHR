## What is EHR?

1.A digital form of a medical record.

2.EHRs have actually been in used since the 1970s but were limited to large hospital systems as they were costly to maintain.

3. With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care act on 6/28/2012. All medical providers were mandated to transition from paper charts to digital medical charts.

4. Originally the thought was to have a unified charting system that could be accessed anywhere in the country by any medical provider. Of course, that’s not what happened.

5.By most estimates there’s currently 500 EHR vendors and none of them communicate with each other.
